Biblical worship is empowered by the Holy Spirit, where new creatures begin to treasure God above all competing affections. This internal treasuring of God wells up into outward praise and an ongoing transformation of life in line with what the Scriptures teach about God and our worship of Him. While biblical worship encompasses all of life (no need for a special place), believers worship in a very important and biblically mandated way when they come together and worship corporately with other fellow worshippers.</description>
